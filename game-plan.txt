Game Class(...)

superclass
  players are params
  user input prompts
  *** has Turn and Question ***

  variable = turn number
  method: calc lives left for player (subtract)
  method: repeat for other player turn (loop?)
  method: generate random math problem  (separate fn)

  knows when game is over, lives of player depleted.






Players class

  no user input, only static info
  variables = player #
  variables = lives

  wrong?
  contains Player1 and Player2 subclasses?
